# SE-350-Project

This project was for my SE 350 Object Oriented Software Development course. 
For the project I created a GUI that is a grid populated with islands, 
pirates, sea-monsters, and one player ship. The user has control of the 
ship named Christopher Columbus. The user's objective is to reach the treasure 
without being caught by the sea-monsters or pirates. The pirates pursue the 
user, while the sea-monsters go back and forth in a vertical or horizantal 
line. In the project I used various different design patterns. The decorator 
design pattern was used for the user's powerups, which are given to the player
by moving onto a question block. The observer design patter was used for the 
pirates, so that they can follow the user. A singleton was used for the ocean map.
